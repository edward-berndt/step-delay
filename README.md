An audio effect that is a hybrid between a delay and a step sequencer.

Instead of having a feedback dial to control how often you want the signal to be repeated, Step-Delay offers you full control and flexibility over the gain and filter frequency of each repetition.
That way you can easily create interesting rhythmic patterns, that regular delays could not achieve.
